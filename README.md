# Azure Storage

Azure Storage is a cloud-based storage service provided by Microsoft Azure that offers **high availability, durability, scalability, and security** for storing different types of data. It is widely used in cloud applications, big data analytics, backups, and disaster recovery.

## 1. Azure Storage Account
An **Azure Storage Account** is a container that provides access to Azure Storage services. It allows you to manage different types of storage under a single account.

### Types of Azure Storage Accounts
- **General-purpose v2 (GPv2)**: Supports all storage services (Blob, File, Queue, Table, and Disk).
- **Blob Storage Account**: Optimized for Blob Storage.
- **FileStorage Account**: Optimized for Azure Files with premium performance.
- **BlockBlobStorage Account**: Optimized for large-scale block blobs.

---

## 2. Types of Azure Storage Services

### A. Azure Blob Storage
Used for **storing unstructured data**, such as text, images, videos, backups, and logs.

#### Blob Storage Tiers
- **Hot Tier**: Frequently accessed data.
- **Cool Tier**: Infrequently accessed data (lower cost but higher access fees).
- **Archive Tier**: Rarely accessed data (cheapest, but slow retrieval).

#### Types of Blobs
- **Block Blob**: Optimized for streaming and storing files.
- **Append Blob**: Used for logging and appending data.
- **Page Blob**: Used for virtual machine (VM) disks.

**Use Cases:**
- Hosting static websites.
- Storing backups and logs.
- Storing large datasets for analytics.

---

### B. Azure File Storage
A **managed file share service** that allows access over **SMB (Server Message Block)** or **NFS (Network File System)** protocols.

**Use Cases:**
- Lift-and-shift applications.
- Shared storage for applications.
- File storage for virtual desktops (FSLogix).

---

### C. Azure Table Storage
A **NoSQL key-value store** for storing structured, non-relational data.

**Use Cases:**
- Storing logs and telemetry data.
- IoT applications.
- User profile storage.

---

### D. Azure Queue Storage
A **message queue service** for decoupling application components and processing asynchronous requests.

**Use Cases:**
- Event-driven applications.
- Communication between microservices.
- Background task processing.

---

### E. Azure Disk Storage
Used for **virtual machine (VM) disks** with high performance and low latency.

#### Disk Storage Types
- **Standard HDD**: Cost-effective for low workloads.
- **Standard SSD**: Good for web servers and small databases.
- **Premium SSD**: High-performance applications (e.g., databases).
- **Ultra SSD**: Extreme performance with low latency.

**Use Cases:**
- Virtual machine OS and data disks.
- High-performance databases.
- Enterprise applications.

---

## 3. Azure Storage Security & Access Control
Azure Storage ensures **data protection and access control** through various mechanisms:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** for secure role-based access.
- **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** for temporary access.
- **Storage Account Keys** for full control over the account.

### Data Encryption
- Encryption at **rest** (using Azure Storage Service Encryption).
- Encryption in **transit** (using HTTPS).
- Customer-managed keys (CMK) for enhanced security.

### Access Control Mechanisms
- **Private Endpoints** for secure communication within Azure Virtual Network.
- **Firewall and Virtual Network Rules** to restrict access.

## 4. Azure Storage Redundancy & Replication
To ensure **data availability and durability**, Azure Storage provides different replication options:

| Replication Type | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)** | Data replicated within a single datacenter. |
| **Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)** | Data replicated across multiple availability zones. |
| **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)** | Data replicated across regions with failover support. |
| **Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)** | Read access available in the secondary region. |

---

## 5. Azure Storage Pricing
Azure Storage pricing depends on:
- **Storage type** (Blob, File, Queue, Table, Disk).
- **Replication type** (LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS).
- **Storage tier** (Hot, Cool, Archive).
- **Data egress and retrieval operations**.

Use the **[Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/calculator/)** to estimate costs.

## 6. Monitoring & Managing Azure Storage
Azure provides **various tools** for monitoring and managing storage:

âœ… **Azure Portal** â€“ GUI for managing storage accounts.  
âœ… **Azure CLI / PowerShell** â€“ Command-line tools for automation.  
âœ… **Azure Storage Explorer** â€“ GUI for managing files and blobs.  
âœ… **Azure Monitor & Metrics** â€“ Logs and alerts for performance monitoring.

---

## 7. Common Use Cases
âœ… **Web and Mobile Apps** â€“ Storing images, videos, and application data.  
âœ… **Big Data & Analytics** â€“ Using Blob Storage for data lakes and AI/ML.  
âœ… **Backup & Disaster Recovery** â€“ Storing backups in Archive Tier.  
âœ… **Hybrid Cloud & File Sharing** â€“ Using Azure Files for shared file access.  
âœ… **Container & VM Storage** â€“ Using Managed Disks for Azure VMs.
